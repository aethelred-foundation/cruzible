# Cruzible Security Compliance Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the current security compliance posture for the Cruzible smart-contract workspace.

Status: **audit-candidate / pre-production hardening**.

The live code includes remediations for the previously tracked critical issues, and local tests pass. This report does not assert production readiness. External audit, deployment scripts, staging validation, real chain integration, and remaining TODO closure are required before any mainnet readiness claim.

## Remediation Summary

| Control area                 | Compliance position                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vault reward index           | Implemented to prevent repeat reward claims and stale reward capture.                                                   |
| Vault unbonding double claim | Implemented with claim-state tracking and terminal request handling.                                                    |
| Vault rounding controls      | Implemented with protocol-favorable rounding coverage.                                                                  |
| Vault stAETHEL lifecycle     | Implemented mint-on-stake/compound/restake and burn-on-unstake contract calls.                                          |
| Vault donation controls      | Implemented with accounted balance and donation handling.                                                               |
| AI job Paid state            | Implemented to prevent repeated settlement of the same verified job.                                                    |
| Governance snapshots         | Implemented to avoid mutable or placeholder vote weight.                                                                |
| Governance feeder oracle     | Multi-feeder median consensus with tolerance, cooldown, quarantine, and caps.                                           |
| Governance feeder control    | Production-mode feeder membership changes require governance self-execution.                                            |
| Governance quorum            | Implemented to gate proposal execution.                                                                                 |
| Model registry fees          | Implemented registration fee amount and denom enforcement.                                                              |
| Model registry authorization | Implemented submit-time verified-model checks, job-manager authorization, and liveness-safe verified-job count updates. |
| Seal manager job provenance  | Implemented cross-contract job checks before seal creation.                                                             |

## Pre-Production Checklist

Completed for audit-candidate state:

- [x] Prior vault criticals remediated.
- [x] Vault stAETHEL mint/burn lifecycle covered by tests.
- [x] AI job payment double-claim guard remediated.
- [x] Governance snapshot, quorum, and feeder-oracle controls remediated.
- [x] Model registry fee amount/denom, submit-time verified-model checks, job-manager authorization, and liveness-safe verified-job count updates remediated.
- [x] Seal manager cross-contract job check remediated.
- [x] Local `cargo test` evidence passes with 247 tests.
- [x] CI workflow enforces contract fmt, clippy, tests, dependency audit, and wasm release build.
- [x] CI workflow uploads commit-scoped wasm artifacts, `SHA256SUMS`, and `manifest.json`.
- [x] Residual review items and deployment assumptions are documented in `AUDIT_PACKET.md`.
- [x] Release manifest template is checked in and validated in CI.
- [x] Strict release manifest validation reconciles staging records with signed artifact evidence.
- [x] Release manifest validation reconciles instantiate messages and funds with reviewed role/config wiring.
- [x] Release manifest validation requires final post-instantiate CW20 minter and model registry role wiring evidence.
- [x] Artifact signing and verification scripts are checked in and syntax-checked by CI.
- [x] Governance feeder oracle config rejects unsafe quorum, tolerance, capacity, and production authority settings.

Required before production readiness:

- [ ] Independent external audit completed.
- [ ] Audit findings remediated or explicitly risk accepted.
- [ ] Staging deployment manifest completed and reviewed with code IDs, addresses, checksums, and role owners.
- [ ] Optimized wasm artifacts signed with production release keys.
- [ ] Staging deployment validated on a real chain.
- [ ] End-to-end cross-contract integration tested.
- [ ] Residual review items closed or formally accepted.
- [ ] Operational runbooks completed for keys, pauses, upgrades, monitoring, and incident response.

## Compliance Position

The current evidence supports an audit-candidate designation. It does not support a production-ready or mainnet-ready designation.

## Recommended Controls Before Launch

- CI job that runs tests, formatting, clippy, dependency audit, schema generation, and wasm optimization.
- Release checklist with artifact hashes and deployment parameters.
- Detached signatures for artifact checksums and manifests.
- Staging drill for instantiate, post-instantiate role wiring, execute, query, pause, migration, and recovery flows.
- External audit report linked to final remediation commits.
- Monitoring thresholds for vault solvency, reward distribution, payment claims, governance execution, and seal creation.
