## 1. Scope

This document only covers measurement paths that are backed by code or scripts present in this repository today. Where deployment automation is still incomplete, treat the targets below as operator goals rather than already-enforced release gates.

## 2. What Can Be Measured From This Repo Now

| Area | Available measurement path | Backing artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend build health | `npm run build` | root `package.json` |
| Frontend bundle analysis | `npm run analyze` | root `package.json` |
| Frontend test coverage | `npm run test:coverage` | root `package.json` |
| API latency smoke test scaffold | `cd backend/api && npm run benchmark` | `backend/api/package.json` |
| API readiness | `GET /health` and `GET /health/ready` | `backend/api/src/routes/health.ts` |
| API route documentation | `GET /docs` | `backend/api/src/config/swagger.ts` and route annotations |
| Contract test coverage baseline | `cd backend/contracts && cargo test --all` | `backend/contracts` |

## 3. Service Objectives

### Frontend

| Metric | Target | How to measure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Production build succeeds | 100% | `npm run build` |
| Landing and vault pages remain usable on desktop/mobile | manual smoke plus page review | local run or deployed preview |
| Initial page performance stays within a normal modern app envelope | LCP under 2.5s when tested on representative infra | Lighthouse/manual testing |
| Regressions in bundle growth are investigated | analyze on meaningful changes | `npm run analyze` |

### API

| Metric | Target | How to measure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/health` remains fast enough for probes | p95 under 250ms on representative infra | `npm run benchmark` or external probe |
| `/health/ready` only returns 200 when core dependencies are healthy | 100% correctness | direct curl / monitoring checks |
| Public route surface remains documented | `/docs` renders and matches route annotations | local run of API |
| Global rate limiter behaves predictably | default 120 requests per 60s unless overridden | automated tests + env review |

### Operational signals already encoded in code

| Signal | Warning threshold | Critical threshold | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Indexer lag | `>100` blocks degrades health | `>500` blocks makes service unready | `backend/api/src/routes/health.ts` |
| Reconciliation status | `WARNING` degrades health | `CRITICAL` makes service unready | `backend/api/src/routes/health.ts` |
| Exchange rate drift | `1%` warning by default | `5%` critical by default | `backend/api/src/services/ReconciliationScheduler.ts` |
| TVL drift | n/a | `2%` threshold by default | `backend/api/src/services/ReconciliationScheduler.ts` |

## 4. Recommended Measurement Commands

```bash
# Frontend
npm run build
npm run analyze
npm run test:coverage

# API
cd backend/api
npm run build
npm run test:coverage

# Runtime probes
curl -s http://localhost:3001/health | jq
curl -s http://localhost:3001/health/ready | jq

# Contracts
cd ../contracts
cargo test --all
```

## 5. Notes For Operators

- The current API benchmark script targets a stale path, `http://localhost:3000/v1/health`. Update that target locally before using it as a meaningful latency measurement.
- Some frontend pages still include preview or mock fallback data. User-perceived performance should be interpreted in that context.
- The API exposes Prometheus-compatible process and HTTP metrics at `/metrics`, but the checked-in Compose monitoring stack is incomplete because referenced config assets are missing from `backend/infra/`.
- `CacheService` uses Redis when `REDIS_URL` is configured and production startup requires Redis. Alert history is database-backed when `DATABASE_URL` is configured.

## 6. Known Measurement Gaps

- There is no checked-in Lighthouse budget or automated frontend performance gate.
- There is no checked-in Prometheus or Grafana configuration bundle matching the Compose references.
- The repository does not currently include a complete turnkey deployment that can be treated as the canonical performance environment.
