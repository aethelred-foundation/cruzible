# Public Readiness Register

> Repo-backed readiness register for the current Cruzible workspace.
> Last reconciled on 2026-04-22.

## 1. Purpose

This document is not a launch promise. It is a snapshot-aligned record of:

- what is actually implemented in this repository
- which operator documents now match that implementation
- which gaps still block a clean production or public rollout

## 2. Repo-Backed Deliverables

| Deliverable                                                                           | Status      | Evidence                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Top-level repo guide aligned to current route and startup surface                     | Ready       | `README.md`                         |
| Backend/operator entry point aligned to current backend surface                       | Ready       | `backend/README.md`                 |

| API docs from checked-in Swagger annotations                                          | Partial     | `/docs` once API is running         |
| Health, liveness, and readiness endpoints                                             | Implemented | `backend/api/src/routes/health.ts`  |

## 3. Supported Surface In This Workspace

| Area      | Current state                                                                                                                               |

## 4. Current Readiness Assessment

| Area                               | Assessment | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Documentation baseline             | Good       | Core README, backend README, runbook, env reference, and readiness docs now describe checked-in surfaces instead of inferred ones                                                                                                  |
| Config examples                    | Good       | Frontend and backend examples now separate runtime inputs from scaffold-only values                                                                                                                                                |
| API observability                  | Partial    | Public liveness/readiness probes are implemented, full `/health`, `/metrics`, and `/docs` are token-gated in production, alert history is database-backed when `DATABASE_URL` is configured, and API cache uses Redis when `REDIS_URL` is configured |
| Deployment scaffolding             | Partial    | Compose now builds API and indexer targets from the repository root; referenced config directories still need to be supplied and staged                                                                                            |
| Kubernetes readiness               | Partial    | Frontend, API gateway, and indexer manifests are checked in with fail-closed config/secret requirements; staging validation is still required                                                                                      |
| Admin/ops authentication bootstrap | Partial    | Wallet-backed nonce login, context-bound refresh rotation, logout revocation, refresh-session incident endpoints, and role-gated ops routes exist; production startup now requires at least one configured operator/admin wallet and deployments must apply the auth-state migration |
| Data persistence model             | Partial    | Prisma-backed database state exists for auth, reconciliation, indexer, and alert events; Redis-backed cache is required for production                                                                                             |
| Migration workflow                 | Partial    | Development and production Prisma migration scripts exist; rollback still depends on operator-managed database snapshots                                                                                                           |

## 5. Launch Blockers From The Current Repo State

- Supply and stage-test the config directories referenced by `backend/infra/docker-compose.yml`.
- Capture a contract staging release manifest with wasm checksums, code IDs, contract addresses, and role owners.
- Stage-test `k8s/base/` with real `cruzible-api-config` values and a provisioned `cruzible-api-secrets` Secret.
- Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` for the selected `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ENV`; frontend public-data requests now fail closed when the API URL is missing or obviously points at the wrong network.
- Exercise the `/v1/auth` nonce/login/refresh/logout and session revocation workflow in staging, then provision validated operator/admin address lists for protected routes such as `/v1/alerts` and `/v1/reconciliation/status`.
- Exercise `npm run db:migrate:deploy` in staging and pair it with tested database snapshot/restore procedures.
- Track the temporary Next.js dependency exception in `docs/security/dependency-exceptions.md` until upstream stops bundling `postcss < 8.5.10`.

## 6. Operator Assumptions That Should Be Treated As Explicit

- Secrets are provisioned externally and rotated outside version control.
- PostgreSQL and RPC endpoints are operator-managed dependencies.
- Compose and Kubernetes artifacts in this repository are scaffolding, not complete deployment truth.
- Full operational diagnostics require `OPERATIONAL_ENDPOINTS_TOKEN`; protected
  `/v1` operational endpoints require externally provisioned JWTs.
- Some frontend surfaces are still preview-oriented and should not be mistaken for proof of live on-chain wiring.
- `/devtools` is hidden in production unless `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEVTOOLS=true` is explicitly configured.

## 7. Exit Criteria Before Public Or Production Use

- All missing deployment assets are supplied or the incomplete scaffolding is replaced with a supported path.
- Health probes in manifests match real application endpoints.
- JWT issuance/admin bootstrap is documented and testable.
- Production secret, CORS, and signature-verification settings are verified in the target environment.
- Migration application and rollback procedures are approved for the target deployment platform.
- Operators validate the repo-backed docs against the exact deployment artifact and commit being released.
