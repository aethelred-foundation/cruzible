## 3. Launch Sequence

### Phase 1: Private Testnet (Week 1-2)

- Deploy all contracts to private testnet
- Onboard 10-20 validators
- Run end-to-end staking flow
- Verify TEE attestation across platforms
- Load test with synthetic traffic

### Phase 2: Public Testnet (Week 3-4)

- Open testnet to public
- Bug bounty on testnet contracts
- Community validator onboarding
- SDK integration testing by partners
- Documentation review by community

### Phase 3: Mainnet Soft Launch (Week 5-6)

- Deploy to mainnet with deposit cap (e.g., 10M AETHEL)
- Whitelist initial validator set
- Monitor for 48 hours before removing cap
- Gradual cap increases (10M → 50M → 100M → unlimited)

### Phase 4: Full Launch (Week 7+)

- Remove deposit caps
- Enable circuit breaker with production thresholds
- Open validator onboarding
- Publish audit reports
- Launch bug bounty on mainnet

## 6. Rollback Plan

If a critical issue is discovered post-launch:

1. **Immediate**: Trigger `PauseVault` to halt all operations
2. **Assess**: Determine if funds are at risk
3. **Communicate**: Notify community via Discord + Twitter within 1 hour
4. **Fix**: Deploy contract upgrade via timelock (24h delay) or keeper governance proposal
5. **Verify**: Run full test suite + reconciliation on the fix
6. **Resume**: `UnpauseVault` after fix is deployed and verified
7. **Report**: Publish post-mortem within 72 hours
